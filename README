This is a simple Mandelbrot set renderer aiming to check the
suitability of Haskell for high-performance computing, or to find
suitable approaches.

For this purpose, the renderer was written both in Haskell (GHC) and
pure C versions.

The C version is mature and is making good use of SIMD and SMP
(optimized for a Core 2 duo). The Haskell version isn't mature yet,
and the latest unfinished developments have even been undone in commit
9a3da3cf49.. . It is currently much slower. When I get around
compiling newest ghc versions with LLVM backend and patches for SIMD
support, I might try to finish it (the C version compiled by gcc will
probably always beat it to some extent, though, as in my experience it
generates faster numeric code than clang/LLVM).
