Requires gcc, openmp (e.g. libopenmpi1.3 on Debian) and Gtk
(libgtk2.0-dev) to be installed.

Run

 make optrun

for the default picture, optimized binary. See Makefile for other make
targets.

Run

 .opt/main -h

to see how to pass different coordinates and depth.

The size of the picture is hard coded for now, as I haven't figured
out how to get it from the window in Gtk yet.
